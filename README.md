# Global Internet Flow Visualization

**[Live Demo](https://earth-network.vercel.app/)**

An interactive 3D visualization of simulated global internet traffic flow using Three.js and WebGL. This project showcases nodes representing major cities worldwide and simulates data packets traveling between them.

## Features

*   Interactive 3D globe with high-resolution Earth textures, dynamic clouds, and atmospheric effects.
*   Dynamic nodes representing major global cities, accurately mapped to geographic locations.
*   Real-time (simulated) traffic flow between nodes, visualized with animated arcs and data packets.
*   Intuitive orbit controls for easy rotation, panning, and zooming.
*   User-configurable settings: Adjust the number of visible nodes and data flow intensity via an on-screen UI.
*   Fully responsive design, ensuring optimal viewing on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

This project utilizes modern web technologies to deliver a rich interactive experience:

*   HTML5
*   CSS3
*   JavaScript (ES6+ Modules) for modular and maintainable code.
*   [Three.js (r164)](https://threejs.org/) for advanced 3D rendering and WebGL scene management.
*   [OrbitControls](https://threejs.org/docs/#examples/en/controls/OrbitControls) for seamless camera interaction.

## Controls

*   **Rotate:** Click and drag the mouse.
*   **Zoom:** Use the mouse scroll wheel.
*   **Adjust Nodes:** Use the slider or number input in the controls panel (click the gear icon to show/hide) and click "Reset Sim".
