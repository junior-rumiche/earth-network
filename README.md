## Features

*   Interactive 3D globe with realistic textures (Earth, clouds, atmosphere).
*   Dynamic nodes representing geographic locations.
*   Simulated traffic flow between nodes using animated arcs and packets.
*   Orbit controls for rotating and zooming.
*   Adjustable number of visible nodes via UI controls.
*   Responsive design for various screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

*   HTML5
*   CSS3
*   JavaScript (ES Modules)
*   [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) (for 3D rendering)
*   [OrbitControls](https://threejs.org/docs/#examples/en/controls/OrbitControls) (for camera interaction)

## Controls

*   **Rotate:** Click and drag the mouse.
*   **Zoom:** Use the mouse scroll wheel.
*   **Adjust Nodes:** Use the slider or number input in the controls panel (click the gear icon to show/hide) and click "Reset Sim".
